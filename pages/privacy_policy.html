              <h2>Relevant Legal Bases</h2>

              <h3>Relevant legal bases under the GDPR</h3>
              <p>
                Below you will find an overview of the legal bases under the GDPR on which we process personal data.
                Please note that, in addition to the provisions of the GDPR, national data protection regulations may apply
                in your or our country of residence or establishment. If more specific legal bases are relevant in individual cases,
                we will inform you of these in this Privacy Policy.
              </p>

              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Consent (Art. 6(1) sentence 1 lit. a GDPR)</strong> – The data subject has given consent to the processing
                  of personal data relating to them for one or more specific purposes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Performance of a contract and pre-contractual inquiries (Art. 6(1) sentence 1 lit. b GDPR)</strong> –
                  Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is a party or for taking steps
                  at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Legitimate interests (Art. 6(1) sentence 1 lit. f GDPR)</strong> – Processing is necessary for the purposes
                  of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, provided that the interests, fundamental rights
                  and freedoms of the data subject do not override those interests.
                </li>
              </ul>

              <h3>National data protection regulations in Germany</h3>
              <p>
                In addition to the GDPR, national data protection regulations apply in Germany. This includes, in particular,
                the German Federal Data Protection Act (Bundesdatenschutzgesetz – BDSG). The BDSG contains special provisions regarding
                the right to information, the right to deletion, the right to object, and automated individual decision-making including profiling.
                Furthermore, state data protection laws of the German federal states may apply.
              </p>

              <h3>Notice regarding applicability of the GDPR and the Swiss FADP (DSG)</h3>
              <p>
                These data protection notices serve to provide information under both the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (DSG/FADP)
                and the GDPR. Therefore, for comprehensibility we use GDPR terminology. The legal meaning of the terms continues to be determined
                under Swiss law within the scope of applicability of the Swiss DSG.
              </p>

            <section id="security" class="policy__section">
              <h2>Security Measures</h2>
              <p>
                In accordance with legal requirements, taking into account the state of the art, implementation costs,
                and the nature, scope, circumstances and purposes of processing, as well as the differing likelihood and severity of risks,
                we implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk.
              </p>

              <h3>Securing online connections using TLS/SSL encryption technology (HTTPS)</h3>
              <p>
                To protect users’ data transmitted via our online services against unauthorized access, we use TLS/SSL encryption technology.
                “HTTPS” in the URL indicates that data is transmitted securely and in encrypted form.

                We delete personal data in accordance with legal requirements as soon as the underlying consents are withdrawn
                or no other legal bases for processing apply. Exceptions exist where legal obligations or special interests require longer retention.
